        <p>
            Activity Tracker is a web application designed for people to quickly and easily record their daily activities. 
            Each entry is saved in a personal history, allowing users to review, update, or delete their activities at any time.

            In addition, administrators have tools to view all activities recorded by users, 
            making management and real-time tracking much easier.
